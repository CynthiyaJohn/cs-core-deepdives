# CS Core Deep Dives 🧠

This repository contains focused deep dives into core Computer Science concepts.
Each topic includes:

- Clear explanations (no rote definitions)
- Practical examples
- Java-based code demonstrations
- Interview-oriented insights 🎯

---

## 📁 Structure

- `notes/` — Concept explanations and comparisons
- `code/` — Minimal Java demos aligned with each concept

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Process vs Thread (Operating Systems)

More topics will be added incrementally.

---

## 💻 Code Demonstration

A simple Java program is included to demonstrate:
- A thread executing within the same process
- A separate OS-level process started using `ProcessBuilder`

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build strong fundamentals through consistent, high-quality learning
rather than rushed or superficial projects.
